_Last updated: [Insert Date]_

This tool is designed to support collaborative exploration and mapping of the generative AI landscape in the context of official statistics. It is used in workshops, conferences, and related environments where participants co-create a shared view of emerging challenges, opportunities, and actors.

## Data Policy

- Shared publicly as part of workshop outputs
- Used in visualizations or reports
- Reused to improve the collective understanding of the AI ecosystem in official statistics

**Please do not submit any sensitive, personal, confidential, or proprietary information.**

## Use and Storage

Submitted data is stored in a cloud-based system for use during and after workshops. Data may be transmitted to or processed by third-party systems for analysis and visualization purposes (e.g., via APIs or analytics platforms). No authentication or identity verification is required or stored unless explicitly stated elsewhere.

## Reuse and Licensing

Unless otherwise noted, data submitted is assumed to be provided under a [Creative Commons Zero (CC0)](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/) license, allowing unrestricted reuse and redistribution.
